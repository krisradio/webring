    <h2>Power Generation</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to source electrical power from the Earth’s natural resources. Common forms of energy sourcing are solar, wind, and hydro. In order to decide which form to use, I looked at the viability of each on a small scale. First one out was hydro. While not impossible, the idea of needing to find a running body of water to dam and finding the proper resources to harvest the resulting energy proved to be a very hard task. Next, wind is a very common source of energy on a large-scale format. And while there are small-scale wind turbines, the availability and reliability of these small-scale devices don’t seem to be at a point where we could use them at a reasonable price point. The last form is solar. Solar panels for home use are being researched and developed every day, they aren’t as dangerous to the environment as wind turbines, require less maintenance due to the lack of moving parts, and depending on where you put them, every day you will get power, unlike days without wind. Thus solar will be our chosen source of power.</p>

    <h3>Financial Analysis<h3>
      <p>In order to power our lights and pump, I discovered we would need 4 solar panels. I chose to use the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Grape-Solar-180-Watt-Monocrystalline-PV-Solar-Panel-for-Cabins-RV-s-and-Back-Up-Power-Systems-GS-STAR-180W-US/301024442">Grape Solar 180W</a> panel from Home Depot, as it is a very efficient panel at only $200 + tax. Since we need 4 of them, the total cost including tax is $860.90. For our charge controller, the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Renogy-Rover-Elite-12-Volt-24-Volt-40-Amp-MPPT-Solar-Charge-Controller-RCC40RVRE-G1/312880021">Rover Elite charge controller</a> for $141.30 can handle 40 amps of current. The total for the power generation cost comes out to $1002.20. The amount of energy that we need during the months with less insolation will be met, and during months with greater insolation, an inverter can be installed to sell energy back to PSE.</p>

    <h3>Ecological Analysis</h3>
      <p>The decision to go solar is two-fold. We’re working towards a goal to “decentralize”. In this regard, we have found a way to power our own food source. But we also have managed to do this without relying on fossil fuels or coal, which are two major providers for electricity in the United States.</p>
